GHCLI
=====

An effort to build a somewhat portable, simple and easily
comprehendable GitHub commandline utility so you can avoid the web
browser entirely.

But hold on, there is an official utility out there!

Yes, but it is written in Go, which is a security nightmare for sane
people using Tor. This is, because the Go runtime circumvents the DNS
resolution mechanisms of the Operating System entirely, thus at least
leaking your IP to the DNS server.
