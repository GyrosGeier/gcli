** DONE handle errors from the github api
   - [[file:src/curl.c::ghcli_fetch(const char *url, ghcli_fetch_buffer *out)][gcli_fetch]]
   - [[file:src/curl.c::ghcli_curl(FILE *stream, const char *url, const char *content_type)][gcli_curl]]
** TODO find a better way to pass the content type to gcli_curl
** DONE Man page
** DONE fetch PR comments
** DONE leaks of huge buffers [50%]
   We don't care about the little strings we sometimes malloc. But the
   huge buffers are annoying.
   - [X] Valgrind [100%]
	 - [X] issues
	 - [X] issues create
	 - [X] pulls
	 - [X] pulls create
	 - [X] comment
	 - [X] reviews
   - [ ] custom LD_PRELOAD hack
** DONE issues comments doesn't print the first comment
   it seems to reside in the issue data itself
   - solved by printing issue summaries
** TODO we don't handle pagination of the api results
   - [ ] See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#pagination
** TODO speed up json_escape
** DONE repo-specific config file
** DONE comment under PR/Issue
** TODO make the use of C strings and string views more consistent
** DONE get rid of mktemp cuz binutils ld bitches about it
   #+begin_example
   src/editor.o: In function `gcli_editor_get_user_message':
   editor.c:(.text+0x108): warning: the use of `mktemp' is
		   dangerous, better use `mkstemp' or `mkdtemp'
   #+end_example
** DONE Check for multiple Github remotes and choose the right one
   Solved in commit 4be0ca8. Leave it up to the user to point at the
   right repo. Also, there are the -o and -r flags.
** DONE Valgrind the new fork stuff
** DONE Ask the user if they want to add a git remote if a fork is created
** DONE repos subcommand fails if -o is a user
** DONE Add docs for gists subcommand
** TODO add flags for sorting
   - [ ] gists
   - [ ] releases
** DONE Creating releases [100%]
   - [X] body
   - [X] choose a git tag
   - [X] attach files to release (aka assets)
   - [X] mark as prerelease or draft
** DONE pulls commit table header is weird
** DONE Check unnecessary includes
** DONE Valgrind again
** DONE write colors test for big-endian machines
** DONE Implement adding/removing labels from github prs
** TODO CI [83%]
   - [X] release resources properly
   - [X] check that we are connecting to github if we ever use the
	 =ci= subcommand [[file:src/gcli.c::if (gcli_config_get_forge_type() != GCLI_FORGE_GITHUB)][see here]]
   - [X] (maybe) integrate ci checks in status subcommand
   - [X] Split =status= and =summary= subcommands:
	 - =summary= should print header and commits
	 - =status= should print summary and checks
   - [X] overflow bug in id
   - [ ] dump logs I dunno whether i really want to implement
	 that. the problem is that github is misbehaving and doesn't give
	 me any association from the checks api to the actions api. maybe
	 I wanna add an actions subcommand that handles this very case for
	 github.
** DONE Unify Gitea and Github code

   Probably we want to make wrappers around the GitHub code for the
   cases where it works. For this to work, we need to mess with
   =github_get_apibase()= to return the right thing if we are looking
   at gitea.

** TODO Optimise =pad()= in [[file:src/table.c][file.c]]

** Label shit

   #+begin_example
   $ gcli labels
   <red>bug</red> - something is broken
   ...
   $ gcli labels create --description 'something is broken' --color FF0000 bug
   $ gcli labels delete bug
   #+end_example

   - for colors see [[https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/color.h][git implementation]]
