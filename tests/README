This is the test suite for gcli. It is rather tiny as of now and only
tests for known bugs.

For it to run you will need:

- Kyua
- ATF-C

These tools are basic testing utilities that are used on all BSDs.

You can run the test suite by invoking `make check' in the toplevel
directory. Please only run it from there as the toplevel makefile may
need to compile the static library containing all the functions that
will be tested.
